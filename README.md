# Trilateration
In this project we read the nodes from a json file, calculate their number and then calculate all possible triple combinations, with the possibility to adjust the combination length. After getting all possible combinations, we perform trilateration for each combination. The program displays all combinations as well as all combinations from the trilateration execution. Also it creats a graph for all points that trilateration returns.
